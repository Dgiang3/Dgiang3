### Profile
My name is Dat Giang, and I'm currently a fourth year Electrical Engineering student at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA). My specialization is in computer engineering, and I am interested in pursuing a career in embedded systems. Specifically, the type of work that I would hope to do involves creating a smarter home that is interconnected through the internet of things (IoT) devices. While I'm not working on projects, I like to make notes using TeX Studio + MikTeX Console to make neatly formatted LaTeX documents to help out other students learn about different concepts within electrical engineering or mathematics. A few of my hobbies include:

- Gaming
- Note-making with LaTeX
- Story Writing
- Experimenting with different circuits using breadboards

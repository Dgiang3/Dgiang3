### Profile
My name is Dat Giang, and I'm currently a first year graduate electrical engineering student at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA). My undergraduate specialization was computer engineering, but now my specialization is power systems, with an emphasis on research for smart power chips. I am interested in pursuing a career which combines embedded software and power systems. While I'm not working on projects, I like to reinforce my understanding by making notes in LaTeX using TeX Studio with MikTeX Console to make neatly formatted documents. Furthermore, it helps me to understand when explaining it to other students with different concepts in electrical engineering or mathematics. A few of my hobbies include:

- Gaming
- Note-making with LaTeX
- Story Writing
- Experimenting with different circuits using breadboards

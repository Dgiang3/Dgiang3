### Profile
My name is Dat Giang, and I'm currently a masters in electrical engineering at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), specializing in computer engineering (undergraduate) and power systems engineering (graduate), with a focus on computational software and battery technology. I am interested in pursuing a career which combines embedded software and power systems. While I'm not working on projects, I like to reinforce my understanding by making notes in LaTeX using TeX Studio and TeXLive to make neatly formatted documents. Furthermore, it helps me to understand when explaining it to other students with different concepts in electrical engineering or mathematics. A few of my hobbies include:

- Gaming
- Note-making with LaTeX
- Story Writing
- Experimenting with different circuits using breadboards
